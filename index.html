				<p>Shorty's is a skateboard label from California. The company was founded in 1992 by Tony Buyalos and April Hamrick. It produces clothing and accessories for skateboards as well as skateboard decks. When Chad Muska left Toy Machine in 1996, Buyalos made him an offer. The two came together and Shorty's started manufacturing skateboards. Muska participated in the design of the boards.
			</p> 
				<p>
					The competence of Shorty's hardware, undoubtedly lies in equipping the deck, axles and castors with all the necessary accessories such as screws, nuts, ball bearings, griptape or steering rubbers.
					Shorty's is still considered a cult in skateboard circles, not least because of outstanding team riders like Chad Muska, Toan Nguyen and Peter Smolik, who have ridden in the former professional team.
